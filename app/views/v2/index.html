        <p class="govuk-body-l">The Community Engagement Playbook is a practical resource that helps people working in local authorities to engage well with their communities. It features reusable and transferable case studies from different councils across England that you can learn from and apply in your own work.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body-l">Inspired by the lessons from COVID-19, the Playbook focuses specifically on digital engagement approaches. </p>

            <p class="gov-uk-body">By community engagement, we mean interacting with different groups within a local area - to understand their views, gather their ideas, start a dialogue or help them take action. </p>
            <p class="gov-uk-body">The case studies in this playbook go beyond just informing people; they are about engaging in a meaningful way. Doing this helps to build trust and ensure that local authorities are responding well to the real needs of their communities.</p>
            <p class="gov-uk-body">Some case studies will be relevant for statutory consultation, but the Playbook’s main focus is engagement more broadly.</p>
