          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">In 2019, Oxford City Council ran a Citizens Assembly on the climate emergency. This resulted in the council committing to 53 specific actions to help fight climate change, including running a youth climate summit to engage young people in the topic.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Run by our staff in the Environmental Sustainability Team, the summit was originally planned as an in-person event. But as the COVID-19 pandemic continued we decided to move it online, and in November 2020 we hosted our first youth climate summit over Zoom and YouTube in November. We collaborated with young people to shape the event, and included interactive tools so that participants could get involved with the discussions and choose what content they wanted to see. The focus of the summit was on how young people could take action on climate change, and it was also an opportunity for decision makers in the council to hear their views.          </p>
          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Date of engagement</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">November 2020</p>
        </div>
        <div id="reasons-for-engagement" class="page-section">
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-padding-top-6">Reasons for engagement</h2>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>To engage young people in climate action, as they will be most affected by climate change.</li>
            <li>To bring young people into the conversation to hear their views.</li>
            <li>To support young people in taking specific actions against climate change.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="steps-to-implement" class="page-section">
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-padding-top-6">Steps</h2>
          <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3">
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Researching what was already happening</h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">We started with researching what was already happening in Oxford with young people and climate action. Who were the young people already active? Who were the organisations working with young people? What sort of work was already happening?</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">This helped us to identify gaps where the summit could play a role, as well as high priority themes we might want to cover. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3">
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Defining the aims and format for the summit</h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">We also decided on the format of the summit; the plan had been for a face-to-face event, but with COVID-19 continuing, this was looking less feasible. We considered partnering with schools once they went back into the classroom after the summer holidays, but we realised that staff already had a lot to deal with due to working on the logistics of getting pupils back to school. In the end we decided to move the summit fully online.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3">
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Engaging with young people to develop the content and format further</h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">To make the content of the summit relevant and engaging for young people, we knew we needed their input to decide what should be included and how it should be run. </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">We spoke to different youth groups about what they’d like to see at the summit, and got in touch with young climate activists. We found that they already had lots of ideas for climate action, so we focused the event on enabling them to put these into practice. </p>
              <p class="govuk-body">As an example of how we shaped the content, we discovered that young people wanted to talk more about the global implications of the city’s action on climate change, acknowledging that while rich nations are contributing most to climate change they are not suffering the worst effects. So we reached out to Oxfam, who are based in Oxford, and they were able to record video messages from young climate activists in Uganda and Malawi for us to share.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">To help us develop the format, we reached out to groups that already had experience working online with young people during the pandemic to learn what worked best. We considered using Zoom and including breakout sessions for discussions, but were concerned that this would make the event less accessible. We were really keen to get beyond the usual suspects, and so decided instead to run the event through Zoom but then live stream it through YouTube. We know many young people use YouTube, and it was also the most straightforward way to broadcast the event beyond Zoom.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">We also partnered with a few of the young climate activists to host the event. Rather than the council leading proceedings, we wanted it to feel like an event for young people by young people.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3">
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Promoting the event</h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">Once we had the content development underway, we moved to thinking about how to get the word out about the event. We did this in a few different ways:</p>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>We knew that not many young people followed the council’s social media channels, so we did some paid marketing with online adverts on Facebook and Instagram.</li>
                <li>We engaged early on in the process with Oxford’s Children and Partnership Youth Board, youth groups within different ethnic communities, and art groups that helped to put the word out.</li>
                <li>We worked with the council’s Youth Ambition initiative (part of our Active Communities Team) team, in order to involve the vulnerable young people in the city that they work with. </li>
                <li>We asked the young people who were already involved to share the event through their schools. </li>
                <li>We shared the event details within the council, as we knew many staff have children.</li>
                <li>We also did some engagement with schools, but they weren’t able to engage as much as they’d like to because of Covid. </li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
            <li class="govuk-!-padding-bottom-3">
              <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Running the event</h3>
              <p class="govuk-body">In preparation for the event, we ran several dry runs with everybody involved so that we knew how to work all the technology. Getting Zoom, Slido and YouTube to work together was stressful, but we had support from our IT team. The fact that we’d done lots of practice really helped everything run smoothly on the day.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">On the day, we had four different speakers and xx participants tune in to the two-hour summit. The Shadow Chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, led a session on what young people can do to affect change, covering things such as how they can lobby politicians and get involved in local politics. The council’s scientific advisor also gave a talk, and the participants used Slido to vote on what topic they wanted him to speak out about.</p>
              <p class="govuk-body">Throughout the session, we used Slido to collect questions.</p>

        <div id="evidence-for-success" class="page-section">
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-padding-top-6">Outcomes</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">After the summit, we held a feedback session with the young people involved. It was great to hear that they said they wanted the event to be the first of many.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">We were also keen for the summit discussions to influence decision makers in the city. We had good engagement from the city councillors, particularly the Deputy Leader who was heavily involved on the day and in the pre-summit discussions. The buy-in from decision makers was really positive - they wanted to be involved in the summit and act on what they heard.</p>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Engage early to help shape the event</h4>
              <p class="govuk-body">We engaged early on in the process with Oxford’s Children and Partnership Youth Board, youth groups within different ethnic communities, and art groups that helped to put the word out.</p>

              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Speak to those linked to the community about what methods are best</h4>
              <p class="govuk-body">For us, that meant finding what online formats had already worked well for young people.</p>

            <li>
              <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Start your event promotion early</h4>
              <p class="govuk-body">This is something on reflection we would start earlier next time. We did this with xx weeks to go before the event, but next time we’d begin with earlier teasers before doing later adverts with more detail on the content.</p>

            <li>
